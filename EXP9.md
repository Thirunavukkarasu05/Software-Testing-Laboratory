### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040173
### AIM: 
To write a python program for sum of digits and validate the code using Pytest. 
### Algorithm:

1. Write the python program for sum of digits of a number. 
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested 
should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_sumofdig.py”. 
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest is installed
5. Executethe program as “pytest test_sumofdig.py”. 
6. Stop the program.

### Program:

```
def add(a,b): 
    return a+b 
def test_3_plus_5_equals_8(): 
    assert add(3,5) == 8 
def test_2_plus_3_equals_5(): 
    assert add(2,3) == 6
```

### Output:
![Screenshot 2025-05-15 084243](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1a7e8e6-9d7b-4269-953a-462c770ee641)



### Result:
Thus, the python program for sum of digits is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
